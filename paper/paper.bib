	abstract = {The dynamic embodiment of psychological processes is evident in the association of health outcomes, behavioural traits and psychological functioning with Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The dominant high-frequency component of HRV is an index of the central neural control of heart rhythm, mediated via the parasympathetic vagus nerve. HRV provides a potential objective measure of action policies for the adaptive and predictive allostatic regulation of homeostasis within the cardiovascular system. In its support, a network of brain regions (referred to as the ‘central autonomic network’) maps internal state, and controls autonomic responses. This network includes regions of prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, periaqueductal grey, pons and medulla. Human neuroimaging studies of neural activation and functional connectivity broadly endorse this architecture, and its link with cardiac regulation at rest and dysregulation in clinical states that include affective disorders. In this review, we appraise neuroimaging research and related evidence for HRV as an informative marker of autonomic integration with affect and cognition, taking a perspective on function and organisation. We consider evidence for the utility of HRV as a metric to inform targeted interventions to improve autonomic and affective dysregulation, and suggest research questions for further investigation.},

	abstract = {Background: A growing number of wearable devices claim to provide accurate,
cheap and easily applicable heart rate variability (HRV) indices. This is mainly accomplished
by using wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) and/or electrocardiography
(ECG), through simple and non-invasive techniques, as a substitute of
the gold standard RR interval estimation through electrocardiogram. Although
the agreement between pulse rate variability (PRV) and HRV has been evaluated
in the literature, the reported results are still inconclusive especially when using
wearable devices.
Aim: The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate if wearable devices
provide a reliable and precise measurement of classic HRV parameters in rest as
well as during exercise.
Materials and methods: A search strategy was implemented to retrieve relevant
articles from MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases, as well as, through internet search.
The 308 articles retrieved were reviewed for further evaluation according to the
predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Results: Eighteen studies were included. Sixteen of them integrated ECG - HRV
technology and two of them PPG - PRV technology. All of them examined wearable
devices accuracy in RV detection during rest, while only eight of them during
exercise. The correlation between classic ECG derived HRV and the wearable RV
ranged from very good to excellent during rest, yet it declined progressively as
exercise level increased.
Conclusions: Wearable devices may provide a promising alternative solution for
measuring RV. However, more robust studies in non-stationary conditions are
needed using appropriate methodology in terms of number of subjects involved,
acquisition and analysis techniques implied.},

The PPG signal contains valuable information about heart activity, and there is lots of research interest in its means and analysis for cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there is no arrhythmic PPG dataset publicly available—this paper attempt to provide a toolbox that can generate synthesized arrhythmic PPG signals. The model of a single PPG pulse in this toolbox utilizes two combined Gaussian functions. This toolbox supports synthesizing PPG waveform with regular heartbeats and three irregular heartbeats: compensation, interpolation, and reset. The user can generate a large amount of PPG data with a certain irregularity, with different sampling frequency, time length, and a range of noise types (Gaussian noise and multi-frequency noise) can be added to the synthesized PPG which can all be modified from the interface, and different types of arrhythmic PPGs (as calculated by the model) generated. The generation for large PPG datasets that simulate PPG collected from real humans could be used for testing the robustness of developed algorithms that are targeting arrhythmic PPG signals. Our PPG synthesis tool is publicly available.},

Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed.},

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to study the association between HRV and incident cardiovascular events in populations without known CVD.We performed a meta-analysis and dose–response meta-regression of studies assessing the association between HRV and CVD. We searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane library, ScienceDirect, and CINAHL up to December 2011 for eligible studies. We selected studies that used the standard deviation of the normalized N–N interval (SDNN), low-frequency (LF) or high-frequency (HF) spectral component as a measure of HRV. Primary outcomes were (non)fatal cardiovascular events. Eight studies with a total number of 21 988 participants were included. The pooled relative risk (RR) comparing the lowest level to the highest level of SDNN was 1.35 (95\% CI 1.10, 1.67). The pooled RRs for LF and HF were 1.45 (95\% CI 1.12, 1.87) and 1.32 (95\% CI 0.96, 1.81), respectively. In a meta-regression, the predicted RR of incident CVD of the 10th and 90th HRV (SDNN) percentiles compared with the 50th percentile were 1.50 (95\% CI 1.22, 1.83) and 0.67 (95\% CI 0.41, 1.09).In conclusion, low HRV is associated with a 32–45\% increased risk of a first cardiovascular event in populations without known CVD. An increase in SDNN of 1\% results in an ∼1\% lower risk of fatal or non-fatal CVD.},

	abstract = {Background
               People with depression tend to have lower heart rate variability (HRV), but the temporal sequence is poorly understood. In a sample of the general population, we prospectively examined whether HRV measures predict subsequent depressive symptoms or whether depressive symptoms predict subsequent levels of HRV.
            
            
               Method
               Data from the fifth (1997–1999) and ninth (2007–2009) phases of the UK Whitehall II longitudinal population-based cohort study were analysed with an average follow-up of 10.5 years. The sample size for the prospective analysis depended on the analysis and ranged from 2334 (644 women) to 2276 (602 women). HRV measures during 5 min of supine rest were obtained. Depressive symptoms were evaluated by four cognitive symptoms of depression from the General Health Questionnaire.
            
            
               Results
               At follow-up assessment, depressive symptoms were inversely associated with HRV measures independently of antidepressant medication use in men but not in women. Prospectively, lower baseline heart rate and higher HRV measures were associated with a lower likelihood of incident depressive symptoms at follow-up in men without depressive symptoms at baseline. Similar but statistically insignificant associations were found in women. Adjustments for known confounders including sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, cardiometabolic conditions or medication did not change the predictive effect of HRV on incident depressive symptoms at follow-up. Depressive symptoms at baseline were not associated with heart rate or HRV at follow-up in either sex.

               These findings are consistent with an aetiological role of the autonomic nervous system in depression onset.},
